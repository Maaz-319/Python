== Background

The Point of Sale (POS) system is designed to facilitate sales transactions in a retail environment. It manages inventory, processes orders, and handles customer transactions efficiently. This documentation focuses on the functional aspects of the POS system, providing a clear understanding of its components and operations.

== Requirements

The POS system must fulfill the following requirements:

*Must Have*
- Inventory management: Track and manage stock levels for products.
- Order processing: Handle customer orders, including adding items to the cart and processing payments.
- Transaction handling: Record and manage sales transactions.
- User authentication and authorization: Ensure secure access for different user roles.

*Should Have*
- Reporting and analytics: Generate sales reports and analyze performance data.
- Customer management: Maintain customer information and purchase history.
- User-friendly interface: Provide an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users.

*Could Have*
- Integration with payment gateways: Support various payment methods.
- Multi-currency support: Handle transactions in different currencies.

*Won't Have*
- Extensive CRM features: Focus on basic customer management rather than advanced CRM tools.
- Advanced marketing tools: Limited to basic promotional features.

== Method

The POS system is structured with several key components:

1. **Inventory Management**
    - Manages product information, stock levels, and updates inventory after each transaction.

2. **Order Processing**
    - Handles adding items to the cart, calculating totals, and processing payments.
    - Provides a receipt for the customer.

3. **Transaction Handling**
    - Records transaction details, including date, time, items sold, and total amount.
    - Supports various payment methods.

4. **User Authentication and Authorization**
    - Ensures secure access with different roles (e.g., admin, cashier).
    - Manages user login and permissions.

== Implementation

1. **Database Design**
    - Use a relational database to manage product, transaction, and user data.
    - Key tables: `products`, `transactions`, `users`.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        price DECIMAL(10, 2),
        stock INT
    );

    CREATE TABLE transactions (
        transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        date TIMESTAMP,
        total DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );

    CREATE TABLE users (
        user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50),
        password_hash VARCHAR(255),
        role VARCHAR(50)
    );
    ```

2. **Backend Logic**
    - Implemented in Python with a focus on handling inventory updates, processing orders, and managing transactions.
    - Utilize Flask or Django for a web-based interface.

3. **Frontend Interface**
    - Simple and intuitive user interface for managing sales.
    - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end.

4. **Security**
    - Implement user authentication using hashed passwords and role-based access control.

== Milestones

1. **Phase 1: Planning and Design**
    - Finalize requirements
    - Design database schema

2. **Phase 2: Development**
    - Implement backend logic
    - Develop frontend interface

3. **Phase 3: Testing**
    - Conduct unit and integration tests
    - Perform user acceptance testing

4. **Phase 4: Deployment**
    - Deploy to production environment
    - Monitor and perform maintenance

== Gathering Results

Evaluate the POS system based on:
- Functionality: Does it meet the specified requirements?
- Performance: How efficiently does it handle transactions?
- Usability: Is the interface user-friendly?
- Security: Are user data and transactions secure?
