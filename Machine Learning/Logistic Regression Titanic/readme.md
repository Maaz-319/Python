# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project builds a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using key features such as class, age, number of parents/children, siblings/spouses, and fare. The model was trained on the Titanic dataset, using Python. This is my 1st ever ML project.

## Used Libraries
1. **SKLearn**: For Logistic Regression Model
2. **Joblib**: For Dumping and Loading the Model
3. **Pandas**: For Data Manipulation

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

Using machine learning, this project aims to:
- Identify which factors influenced passenger survival.
- Predict if a passenger would survive based on their personal attributes and ticket class.

### Features Used:
1. **Class**
2. **Age**
3. **Parch**
4. **SibSp**
5. **Fare**

The model output indicates:
- `1` for "Survived"
- `0` for "Did Not Survive"

## Accuracy:- **75%**

## ðŸ›  Project Workflow
1. ### Data Preprocessing
	â€¢ Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, especially for Age.
	â€¢ Feature Engineering: Select and scale the features Pclass, Age, Parch, SibSp, and Fare.
2. ### Model Training
	â€¢ A logistic regression model was trained using scikit-learn.
3. ### Model Saving
	â€¢ The trained model is saved as LogisticRegressionModel.pkl using joblib for quick loading and inference.
4. ### Prediction
â€¢ The model is loaded and used to make predictions on new data, indicating whether a passenger would have survived or not.
